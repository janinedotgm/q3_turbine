# WBA Prerequisites (Rust)

This repository contains functions necessary to complete the Rust prerequisites for the Turbin3 WBA Builders Cohort Q3 2024 program. These functions cover the basics of interacting with the Solana blockchain, sending lamports, and interfacing with the WBA prerequisite program.

## Setup

1. Ensure `dev-wallet.json` is in the `/wallets` directory of the project and populated using the `keygen()` function from `src/lib.rs`.
2. Replace `<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>` in `src/lib.rs` with your GitHub account.
3. Add `wba-wallet.json` containing the private key of your WBA wallet as a wallet file byte array.
